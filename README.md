# WAGASCI Documentation

## Introduction

The T2K (Tokai-to-Kamioka) is a long baseline neutrino experiment
designed to study various parameters that rule neutrino oscillations,
with an intense beam of muon neutrinos. A near detector complex
(ND280) is used to constrain non-oscillated flux and hence to predict
the expected number of events in the far detector
(Super-Kamiokande). The difference in the target material between the
far (water) and near (scintillator, hydrocarbon) detectors leads to
the main non-canceling systematic uncertainty for the oscillation
analysis. In order to reduce this uncertainty a new water grid and
scintillator detector, WAGASCI, has been proposed. The detector will
be operated at the J-PARC neutrino beam line with the main physics
goal to measure the charged current neutrino cross section ratio
between water and hydrocarbon with a few percent accuracy. Further
physics program may include high-precision measurements of different
charged current neutrino interaction channels.

## This Documentation

This Documentation is written in LaTeX and is intended for internal
usage only. For this reason, it is missing any introductiory part to
the T2K and WAGASCI experiments and it is written as a mere list of
recepies to read and follow in order to understand the particular
software and hardware infrastructure of the WAGASCI
experiment. However everyone on Internet can read it and even
contribute if he or she so wishes.

This documentation is still in a very early stage and
work-in-progress. It is always updated on the master branch so what
you see there is always the latest version available. It may lack any
internal coherence and many parts are still a stub.  Enybody is
welcome to fill the gaps and correct anything if necessary.

Until October 2018 there was no written documentation of the WAGASCI
software and hardware and when I (Pintaudi Giorgio) started my PhD at
YNU I struggled quite a lot to gather all the information I needed to
understand the WAGASCI software and hardware framework. Being WAGASCI
an experiment still in progress it is understandable a full-blown
documentations is still missing but I felt that it is time to start
working on that.

## Compilation

I am compiling this tex file with TeX Live 2018 but any other TeX
distribution should be fitting for the task.
